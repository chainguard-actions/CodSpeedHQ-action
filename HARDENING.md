## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

Multiple ${{ inputs.* }} and ${{ steps.*.outputs.* }} expressions are directly interpolated inside run: shell command strings in action.yml, violating sub-rule (a). This allows any calling workflow to inject shell metacharacters via these inputs.

Step 'Determine runner and kernel version': `RUNNER_VERSION="${{ inputs.runner-version }}"` and `MODE_CACHE_KEY=$(echo "${{ inputs.mode }}" | tr ',' '-')` are interpolated directly in the shell script.

Step 'Install CodSpeed runner': `RUNNER_VERSION="${{ steps.versions.outputs.runner-version }}"`, `VERSION_TYPE="${{ steps.versions.outputs.version-type }}"`, `SKIP_HASH_CHECK_WARNING="${{ inputs.skip-hash-check-warning }}"`, and `EXPECTED_HASH="${{ steps.installer-hash.outputs.hash }}"` are all directly interpolated.

Step 'Run the benchmarks': `${{ inputs.mode }}`, `${{ inputs.token }}`, `${{ inputs.working-directory }}`, `${{ inputs.upload-url }}`, `${{ inputs.instruments }}`, `${{ inputs.mongo-uri-env-name }}`, `${{ inputs.cache-instruments }}`, `${{ inputs.instruments-cache-dir }}`, `${{ inputs.allow-empty }}`, `${{ inputs.go-runner-version }}`, and `${{ inputs.config }}` are all directly interpolated in shell commands. These should be passed via env: variables and then referenced as quoted shell variables.

### github-env-injection (severity: high)

In the 'Determine runner and kernel version' step, two values derived from untrusted inputs are written to $GITHUB_OUTPUT without sanitization:

1. `RUNNER_VERSION` is set from `${{ inputs.runner-version }}` (directly interpolated) and then written via `echo "runner-version=$RUNNER_VERSION" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT`. A newline character in the input would inject additional key=value pairs into the output file.

2. `MODE_CACHE_KEY` is computed from `${{ inputs.mode }}` via `MODE_CACHE_KEY=$(echo "${{ inputs.mode }}" | tr ',' '-')` and then written via `echo "mode-cache-key=$MODE_CACHE_KEY" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT`. The `tr ',' '-'` only replaces commas, not newlines.

The required sanitization (`printf '%s' "$VAR" | tr -d '\n\r'`) must be applied immediately before each write.

Locations:

- `action.yml:112`
- `action.yml:121`

### unsafe-shell (severity: high)

In the 'Install CodSpeed runner' step, when the version type is 'latest', the script pipes remote content directly to bash without first downloading and verifying it: `curl -fsSL https://codspeed.io/install.sh | bash -s -- --quiet`. If the remote server is compromised or the URL is intercepted, arbitrary code will execute on the runner. The script should download the installer to a temporary file, verify its hash, and then execute it (as is already done for the release version path).

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, static-inline-injection, github-env-injection, unsafe-shell

**Notes:**

Fixed all security findings in hardened/action/action.yml:

1. script-injection / static-inline-injection: Moved all ${{ inputs.* }} and ${{ steps.*.outputs.* }} expressions from run: blocks to env: blocks in all three affected steps ('Determine runner and kernel version', 'Install CodSpeed runner', 'Run the benchmarks'). Shell scripts now reference plain environment variables ($INPUT_*).

2. github-env-injection: Added newline sanitization before writing to $GITHUB_OUTPUT. Both RUNNER_VERSION and MODE_CACHE_KEY are now sanitized with `printf '%s' "$VAR" | tr -d '\n\r'` before being written to the output file.

3. unsafe-shell: Replaced `curl -fsSL https://codspeed.io/install.sh | bash -s -- --quiet` with a download-then-execute pattern: downloads to a temp file, then executes with `bash "$INSTALL_SCRIPT_TMP" --quiet` (dropped the `--` per instructions since it was the shell's option terminator, not the script's argument). Temp file is cleaned up via trap.
