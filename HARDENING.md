## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

Rule (a): Multiple `${{ ... }}` expressions are directly interpolated inside `run:` shell command strings in action.yml. In the 'Determine runner and kernel version' step, `${{ inputs.runner-version }}` and `${{ inputs.mode }}` are interpolated directly into shell. In the 'Install CodSpeed runner' step, `${{ steps.versions.outputs.runner-version }}`, `${{ steps.versions.outputs.version-type }}`, and `${{ inputs.skip-hash-check-warning }}` are interpolated directly. In the 'Run the benchmarks' step, `${{ inputs.mode }}`, `${{ inputs.token }}`, `${{ inputs.working-directory }}`, `${{ inputs.upload-url }}`, `${{ inputs.instruments }}`, `${{ inputs.mongo-uri-env-name }}`, `${{ inputs.cache-instruments }}`, `${{ inputs.instruments-cache-dir }}`, `${{ inputs.allow-empty }}`, `${{ inputs.go-runner-version }}`, and `${{ inputs.config }}` are all interpolated directly into shell commands. Any of these values can contain shell metacharacters injected by the calling workflow.

### github-env-injection (severity: high)

In the 'Determine runner and kernel version' step, two values derived from untrusted inputs are written to $GITHUB_OUTPUT without sanitization. (1) `RUNNER_VERSION` is set from `${{ inputs.runner-version }}` and then written via `echo "runner-version=$RUNNER_VERSION" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT` — no `printf '%s' ... | tr -d '\n\r'` sanitization is applied. (2) `MODE_CACHE_KEY` is derived from `${{ inputs.mode }}` via `MODE_CACHE_KEY=$(echo "${{ inputs.mode }}" | tr ',' '-')` and then written via `echo "mode-cache-key=$MODE_CACHE_KEY" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT` — again without sanitization. An attacker-controlled newline in these inputs could inject arbitrary key=value pairs into $GITHUB_OUTPUT.

- `action.yml:121`

### unsafe-shell (severity: high)

In the 'Install CodSpeed runner' step, remote content is fetched and piped directly to bash: `curl -fsSL https://codspeed.io/install.sh | bash -s -- --quiet`. If the remote server is compromised or the connection is intercepted, arbitrary code will execute on the runner without any integrity check. The script should be downloaded to a temporary file, its hash verified, and then executed separately.

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, github-env-injection, unsafe-shell, static-inline-injection

**Notes:**

Fixed all findings in action.yml:

1. script-injection / static-inline-injection: Moved all ${{ inputs.* }} and ${{ steps.*.outputs.* }} expressions from run: blocks to env: blocks in three steps:
   - 'Determine runner and kernel version': Added env: block with INPUT_RUNNER_VERSION and INPUT_MODE
   - 'Install CodSpeed runner': Added env: block with RUNNER_VERSION, VERSION_TYPE, SKIP_HASH_CHECK_WARNING, and EXPECTED_HASH (removing the inline ${{ steps.installer-hash.outputs.hash }} from the run block)
   - 'Run the benchmarks': Added INPUT_MODE, INPUT_TOKEN, INPUT_WORKING_DIRECTORY, INPUT_UPLOAD_URL, INPUT_INSTRUMENTS, INPUT_MONGO_URI_ENV_NAME, INPUT_CACHE_INSTRUMENTS, INPUT_INSTRUMENTS_CACHE_DIR, INPUT_ALLOW_EMPTY, INPUT_GO_RUNNER_VERSION, INPUT_CONFIG to the env: block

2. github-env-injection: Sanitized values written to $GITHUB_OUTPUT using printf + tr -d '\n\r' for both runner-version and mode-cache-key outputs.

3. unsafe-shell: Converted 'curl ... | bash -s -- --quiet' to download-then-execute pattern: downloads to a temp file with mktemp, then executes 'bash "$INSTALL_SCRIPT" --quiet' (dropping the '--' which was the shell's option terminator, not the script's argument).
