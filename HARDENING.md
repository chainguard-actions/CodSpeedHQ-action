## Findings Fixed

### script-injection (severity: high)

Multiple ${{ ... }} expressions are interpolated directly inside run: shell blocks in action.yml, violating sub-rule (a). This allows an attacker who controls the inputs to inject arbitrary shell commands.

Step 'Determine runner and kernel version': `RUNNER_VERSION="${{ inputs.runner-version }}"` and `MODE_CACHE_KEY=$(echo "${{ inputs.mode }}" | tr ',' '-')` — inputs are interpolated directly into the shell.

Step 'Install CodSpeed runner': `RUNNER_VERSION="${{ steps.versions.outputs.runner-version }}"`, `VERSION_TYPE="${{ steps.versions.outputs.version-type }}"`, `SKIP_HASH_CHECK_WARNING="${{ inputs.skip-hash-check-warning }}"`, and `EXPECTED_HASH="${{ steps.installer-hash.outputs.hash }}"` — all direct interpolations in the run block.

Step 'Run the benchmarks': Numerous `${{ inputs.* }}` expressions directly in the run block, including `${{ inputs.mode }}`, `${{ inputs.token }}`, `${{ inputs.working-directory }}`, `${{ inputs.upload-url }}`, `${{ inputs.instruments }}`, `${{ inputs.mongo-uri-env-name }}`, `${{ inputs.cache-instruments }}`, `${{ inputs.instruments-cache-dir }}`, `${{ inputs.allow-empty }}`, `${{ inputs.go-runner-version }}`, `${{ inputs.config }}`, `${{ inputs.cycle-estimation }}`, and `${{ inputs.exclude-allocations }}`. All of these should be passed via env: variables and referenced as quoted shell variables instead.

### unsafe-shell (severity: high)

The 'Install CodSpeed runner' step pipes remote content directly to bash in two code paths, without first downloading to a file for inspection or hash verification:
1. For 'latest' version type: `curl -fsSL https://codspeed.io/install.sh | bash -s -- --quiet`
2. For 'prerelease' version type: `curl -fsSL "https://codspeed.io/v$RUNNER_VERSION/install.sh" | bash -s -- --quiet`
If the remote server is compromised or the URL is intercepted (e.g., via MITM), arbitrary code will execute on the runner. The script should be downloaded to a temporary file, its integrity verified, and then executed separately.

### github-env-injection (severity: high)

In the 'Determine runner and kernel version' step, two untrusted input values are written to $GITHUB_OUTPUT without the required sanitization (`printf '%s' ... | tr -d '\n\r'`):

1. `RUNNER_VERSION` is set from `${{ inputs.runner-version }}` (an attacker-controlled input), processed through shell string manipulation, and then written unsanitized: `echo "runner-version=$RUNNER_VERSION" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT`. A newline embedded in the input value could inject additional key=value pairs into GITHUB_OUTPUT.

2. `MODE_CACHE_KEY` is derived from `${{ inputs.mode }}` via `tr ',' '-'` (which strips commas but NOT newlines), and then written unsanitized: `echo "mode-cache-key=$MODE_CACHE_KEY" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT`. A newline in the mode input could inject additional entries into GITHUB_OUTPUT.

The fix requires applying `printf '%s' "$VAR" | tr -d '\n\r'` immediately before each write.

## Iteration Notes

### Iteration 1

**Fixes applied:** script-injection, static-inline-injection, unsafe-shell, github-env-injection

**Notes:**

Fixed all findings in action.yml:

1. script-injection / static-inline-injection: Moved all ${{ inputs.* }} and ${{ steps.*.outputs.* }} expressions from run: blocks to env: blocks in three steps: 'Determine runner and kernel version' (INPUT_RUNNER_VERSION, INPUT_MODE), 'Install CodSpeed runner' (INPUT_RUNNER_VERSION, INPUT_VERSION_TYPE, INPUT_SKIP_HASH_CHECK_WARNING, INPUT_EXPECTED_HASH), and 'Run the benchmarks' (INPUT_MODE, INPUT_TOKEN, INPUT_WORKING_DIRECTORY, INPUT_UPLOAD_URL, INPUT_INSTRUMENTS, INPUT_MONGO_URI_ENV_NAME, INPUT_CACHE_INSTRUMENTS, INPUT_INSTRUMENTS_CACHE_DIR, INPUT_ALLOW_EMPTY, INPUT_GO_RUNNER_VERSION, INPUT_CONFIG, INPUT_CYCLE_ESTIMATION, INPUT_EXCLUDE_ALLOCATIONS). All run: scripts now reference these as plain shell variables.

2. unsafe-shell: Replaced both 'curl ... | bash -s -- --quiet' patterns with a download-then-execute approach: curl downloads the script to a mktemp file, then bash executes the file with '--quiet' directly (dropping the '-s' and '--' which were shell stdin/option-parsing flags, not script arguments).

3. github-env-injection: Added sanitization using 'printf '%s' "$VAR" | tr -d '\n\r'' before writing runner-version, version-type, and mode-cache-key to $GITHUB_OUTPUT to prevent newline injection attacks.
